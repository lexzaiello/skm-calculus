* Towards a Dependently-Typed Combinator Calculus

In this repository, I define a dependent type theory for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_combinator_calculus][SK-combinator]] calculus. I achieve dependent typing by interpreting Π as a free-standing combinator.

See the [[https://lexzaiello.com/skpi-calculus][web book]] for more information.
