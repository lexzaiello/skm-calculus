* TODO Todo
** Lazy value instantiation of combinators
** Inference of type 2
*** Recall, each combinator is explicitly typed
*** We would like to specify a value for =K= for example, without necessarily knowing the second type
*** Or we would like to infer it before compile time
**** Inference algorithm
**** Simple case
=K \Nat ? 0=
